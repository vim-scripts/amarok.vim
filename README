amarok.vim - amaroK integration for vim                                         
                                                                                
This plugin let's you control amaroK (http://amarok.kde.org) from vim. It adds  
a menu to your gvim, and defines a new command called 'AmaroK', which let's     
you control amarok via Ex-commands. Since it uses the dcop-functionality of     
amaroK, you can type in any dcop command the dcop-player-interface of amarok    
supports. For a complete list type: dcop amarok player functions in a terminal  
                                                                                
                                                                                
If you don't like the menu, you can set the g:AmaroK_show_menu-variable to 0    
in your vimrc and the menu will not be displayed
